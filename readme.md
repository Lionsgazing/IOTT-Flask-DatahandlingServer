### How to run
Install flask in your python environment: `python3 -m pip install flask`
When flask is installed and a terminal is loacted in the same directory as the `main.py` file simply run it using flask:
`python3 -m flask --app main run`

This should start a "webserver" that can be accessed using the ip address shown in the terminal.
